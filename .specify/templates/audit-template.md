# Implementation Audit Report

**Audit Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Feature**: [FEATURE NAME]  
**Feature Branch**: [feature-name]  
**Overall Quality Score**: [X]%  
**Production Ready**: [Yes/No]  
**Input**: Implementation in `[feature-directory]` compared against specification documents

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Load specification documents from feature directory:
   → spec.md: Extract all functional requirements (FR-XXX)
   → plan.md: Extract technical design, architecture decisions
   → tasks.md: Extract all tasks and completion status
   → If Reference Context exists: Load patterns and standards
   → If any doc missing: ERROR "Incomplete specification for audit"
2. Scan implementation files:
   → Identify all source files from plan.md structure
   → Read implementation code
   → Check for tests (unit, integration, contract)
   → Examine error handling and validation
   → Review documentation and comments
3. Audit requirements coverage:
   → For each FR in spec.md: Verify implementation exists
   → Test against acceptance scenarios
   → Check edge cases are handled
   → Mark as: Implemented, Partial, Missing
4. Audit task completion:
   → Count tasks marked [X] vs total tasks
   → Identify incomplete tasks
   → Check for skipped test tasks
5. Audit code quality:
   → Code organization and structure
   → Naming conventions consistency
   → Documentation completeness
   → Error handling robustness
   → Security issues (secrets, vulnerabilities)
6. Audit testing:
   → Test coverage for requirements
   → Integration test scenarios
   → Edge case coverage
   → Contract test completeness
7. Compare against technical plan:
   → Architecture alignment
   → Libraries and dependencies used correctly
   → Performance considerations addressed
8. Prioritize issues:
   → Critical: Missing core functionality, security issues
   → High: Incomplete requirements, missing tests
   → Medium: Code quality, minor deviations
   → Low: Style, optimizations
9. Calculate metrics and write to [feature-dir]/AUDIT.md
10. Return: SUCCESS with quality score and production readiness

## ⚡ Audit Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on ALIGNMENT between specification and implementation
- ✅ Verify COMPLETENESS of requirements coverage
- ✅ Assess QUALITY of code and testing
- ❌ Don't nitpick style if it doesn't affect quality

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Missing core functionality, security vulnerabilities, broken acceptance criteria
- **High**: Incomplete requirements, significant deviations, missing tests
- **Medium**: Code quality issues, minor deviations, documentation gaps
- **Low**: Style inconsistencies, optimization opportunities

### For AI Generation

When creating this audit report:

1. **Be objective**: Use measurable criteria from specification
2. **Show evidence**: Reference exact requirements and file paths
3. **Test acceptance criteria**: Actually validate each scenario
4. **Check edge cases**: Verify error scenarios from spec.md
5. **Common audit findings**:
   - Missing requirements implementation
   - Incomplete task execution
   - Insufficient test coverage
   - Unhandled edge cases
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Performance issues
   - Documentation gaps
