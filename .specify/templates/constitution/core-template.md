## 2. Coding Standards

| Area               | Standard                             | Enforcement | Validation          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------- |
| **Language**       | [LANGUAGE_STANDARD]                  | MUST        | Automated linting   |
| **Type Safety**    | [TYPE_SAFETY_REQUIREMENTS]           | MUST        | Compile-time        |
| **Async Patterns** | [ASYNC_PATTERN_REQUIREMENTS]         | MUST        | Code review         |
| **Modularity**     | [MODULARITY_STANDARDS]               | MUST        | Architecture review |
| **Error Handling** | [ERROR_HANDLING_PATTERN]             | MUST        | Automated linting   |
| **Logging**        | [LOGGING_LIBRARY]; [LOGGING_PATTERN] | MUST        | Automated scanning  |
| **Secrets**        | [SECRET_HANDLING_RULES]              | MUST        | Secret scanning     |

| **DTOs/Models**    | [DTO_NAMING_CONVENTIONS]             | MUST        | Code review         |

### Error Handling Example

```typescript
try {
  const result = await operation();
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Operation failed', { correlationId, error });
  throw error;
}
```

### Core Requirements

- **Logging**: Structured format, correlation ID, no secrets, consistent field names
- **Secrets**: No plaintext in code/env/logs/errors
- **Validation**: Validate/sanitize all external inputs, type & boundary checking
- **DTOs**: Clear naming, type annotations, immutability preferred, validation methods

| **Strategy**      | [API_VERSIONING_STRATEGY]                  | MUST     | URL path or header based |
| Version support   | Support previous version during transition | MUST     | Minimum 6 months         |
| Breaking changes  | Document all breaking changes              | MUST     | In CHANGELOG and docs    |
| Deprecation       | Deprecate endpoints before removal         | MUST     | Minimum 3 months notice  |
| Migration guides  | Provide guides for major versions          | SHOULD   | With code examples       |
